Yes, You heard it right, Let's make Cirno be a intellectual being!

## What is this?

[Deep Q Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) for playing Touhou Project but It can be extended to _ANY™_ games.  
(Currently Only Supporting Touhou Project 12: Unidentified Fantastic Object)

~~I think it is better for ROBOT FAIRY™ uprising than just a SKYNET™ uprising.~~

## Supported Platforms

- Micro$oft Window$® Platforms
- Linux Systems whose Desktop Manager has GTK3 Support *EXCLUDING [TmaxOS](https://tmaxos.com)*  
- Experimental support for macOS
  - macOS systems versions less than equal with macOS Mojave with WineHQ installed (experimental, but rather stable)
  - macOS Catalina or above with [crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/products) installed (experimental)

Reason why TmaxOS is not supported is due to their bizzare GTK implementation AND Touhou Project is unable to run with Windows Compatibility layer.  
Since TmaxOS is *not allowing* people to reverse engineer their software for *compatibility reasons*. I am ***NOT*** going to support this platform.
