Yes, You heard it right, Let's make Cirno be a intellectual being!

## What is this?

[Deep Q Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) for playing Touhou Project but It can be extended to _ANY™_ games.  
(Currently Only Supporting Touhou Project 12: Unidentified Fantastic Object)

~~I think it is better for ROBOT FAIRY™ uprising than just a SKYNET™ uprising.~~

[™](http://law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=203191&efYd=20181018#0000)

## Supported Platforms

- Micro$oft Window$® Platforms
- Linux Systems whose Desktop Manager has GTK3 Support EXCLUDING [TmaxOS](https://tmaxos.com)

Yes, bad news here. macOS didn't make it. But Tim Cook is deprecating x86 support so, Initial reason of continuing this project is Artificial intelligence that can play Touhou Project. So, I will not support it for *NOW™*.  
**P.S. I updated my Macbook Pro to macOS Catalina, So I WON'T do any support stuff for macOS ever, but I might be supporting  x64 when x64 touhou project is out.**
