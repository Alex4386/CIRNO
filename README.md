Yes, You heard it right, Let's make Cirno be a intellectual being!

## What is THE CIRNO Project?

It's a recursive acronym of:  
**C**IRNO: **I**ntelligence for ingame **R**ecognition, **N**avigation and **O**peration.  
basically an artificial intelligence based on Reinforcement Learning to play games for you.  

[Deep Q Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) for playing Touhou Project but It can be extended to _ANY™_ games.  

(Currently Only Supporting Touhou Project 12: Unidentified Fantastic Object)

~~I think it is better for ROBOT FAIRY™ uprising than just a SKYNET™ uprising.~~  

## Supported Platforms

### Client
Client will actually run the game and send information to Machine Learning Server,  
If your computer has enough computing power, you can run client on same machine. though.  

- Micro$oft Window$® Platforms
- Linux Systems Running Python3 Script inside of Wine or Similar WINAPI Compatibility Solutions ***EXCLUDING [TmaxOS](https://tmaxos.com)***

Reason why TmaxOS is not supported is due to their bizzare WINAPI Implementation AND Touhou Project is unable to run with Windows Compatibility layer.  
Since TmaxOS is *not allowing* people to reverse engineer their software for *compatibility reasons*. I am ***NOT*** going to support this platform.  

### Server
Server will run the all Deep Q Learning and Convolutionary Neural Network Job.  
Personally, I developed server with consideration of running on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but following platforms are also supported.  

- Micro$oft Window$®
- macOS
- Linux
