# CIRNO
**C**onvolutional neural network based  
**I**ntelligence for  
**R**ecognizing game status to  
**N**avigate and  
**O**perate the player  

Yes, You heard it right, Let's make Cirno be a intellectual being!  

## Thesis
Brief idea:  
Process the Image:  
Raw Pixel Data as matrices:  
implement reinforcement learning idea from [Google I/O 2018: Reinforcement Learning without a PhD.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1A3NTttvBA) ~~(well i can ask my professor, but this project is somehow embarrassing to show him)~~  

  
Since controlling is much like a categorization,  
we are going to use ConvNet with reLU (if possible, leaky reLU) and will use softmax for final decision.  

The goal:  
Creating General Artifical Neural Network for solving all Touhou Project games (which seems impossible for me, but let me try)
